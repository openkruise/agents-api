# Customized E2B SDK patch

This Python library patches the E2B client, converting the native E2B protocol to the OpenKruise Agents private
protocol, thereby simplifying sandbox-manager deployment.

## Installation

### Install from source via git

```bash
# Replace "main" with a specific version tag (e.g., "v0.1.0") from
# https://github.com/openkruise/agents-api/releases to pin a version tag.
pip install git+https://github.com/openkruise/agents-api.git@${VERSION}#subdirectory=e2b/python
```

### Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openkruise/agents-api.git
cd e2b/python
pip install -e .
```

## Problem Statement

The E2B SDK requests the backend using the following protocol:

| Protocol                    | Description          | Example                                |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| api.E2B_DOMAIN              | Management interface | api.e2b.dev                            |
| \<port\>-\<sid\>.E2B_DOMAIN | Sandbox interface    | 49999-i37sc83s52e2cv85h636jjgs.e2b.dev |

Meanwhile, E2B SDK forces the use of HTTPS.

In our practice, we found that in K8s scenarios, this protocol has the following issues:

1. Requires configuring wildcard domain resolution to the management service (sandbox-manager), unable to use methods
   like hosts for resolution.
2. Requires using expensive wildcard certificates.

The above issues simultaneously make deploying a backend service compatible with E2B have a high threshold: not only
increasing user costs, but also making it difficult to automate the setup of an E2E test environment.

## Usage

Requirements:

- Python 3.9 or newer
- `e2b>=2.8.0`
- `e2b-code-interpreter>=2.4.1`

```python
from kruise_agents.patch_e2b import patch_e2b
from e2b_code_interpreter import Sandbox

patch_e2b(https=False)  # patch sdk

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with Sandbox.create() as sbx:
        sbx.run_code("print('hello world')")
```

## Traffic JWT Refresh

Traffic JWT refresh is an independent, opt-in monkey patch. It requires Python
3.10 or newer, `e2b>=2.35.0,<2.38.0`, and
`e2b-code-interpreter>=2.9.0,<2.10.0`.

```python
from kruise_agents.patch_e2b import patch_e2b
from kruise_agents.patch_traffic_token import patch_traffic_access_token

patch_e2b(https=False)
patch_traffic_access_token()
```

When a Sandbox is configured for Traffic JWT authentication, the patch keeps
its token in memory and refreshes it before expiration. Sync and async envd
HTTP/RPC requests and code-interpreter Jupyter requests read the latest token
immediately before sending. Refreshes for one Sandbox that overlap on the same
sandbox-manager replica are combined into one issuance. The completed result is
not cached by sandbox-manager; a later refresh request issues a new token.
Legacy opaque traffic tokens keep their existing behavior and do not enable
expiration-based refresh.

Connect only resumes or extends the Sandbox and does not issue a token. A
class-level `Sandbox.connect(sandbox_id)` checks the Sandbox metadata with
`get_info()`; for JWT-protected Sandboxes without a token, the first data-plane
request refreshes one before sending.

Sync and async clients refresh on demand immediately before a data-plane
request. Refresh failures continue using the previous token while it remains
valid; once expired, data-plane calls fail locally with
`TrafficAccessTokenExpired` instead of sending a known-invalid credential.

An application can explicitly refresh a token when needed:

```python
token = sandbox.refresh_traffic_access_token(force=True)
token = await async_sandbox.refresh_traffic_access_token(force=True)
```

## Rollout

Sandbox-manager preserves the legacy, approximately 100-year Traffic JWT
validity by default. Deploy this patch, or another client with equivalent
refresh support, before configuring a shorter
`--traffic-access-token-validity` for existing JWT-authenticated workloads.
Clients that do not refresh will lose data-plane access when a short-lived
token expires.

Deploy the lazy-Connect SDK behavior before upgrading sandbox-manager to a
version that no longer issues Traffic JWTs from Connect. Older clients cannot
recover a missing token when reconnecting by Sandbox ID.
